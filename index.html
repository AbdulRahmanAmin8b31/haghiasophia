            <img src="https://hagiasophiaturkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/History-of-Hagia-Sophia-Featured-Image.png" alt="Hagia Sophia in Early Years">
            <p>
                The Hagia Sophia was commissioned by Byzantine Emperor <span class="highlight">Justinian I</span> in 532 AD after an earlier church on the same site was destroyed during the Nika riots. It was completed in just five years in 537 AD, under the supervision of two prominent architects, <span class="highlight">Anthemius of Tralles</span> and <span class="highlight">Isidore of Miletus</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The architectural brilliance of Hagia Sophia is especially noted for its enormous dome, which was considered a revolution at that time. The central dome rises about 55.6 meters (182 feet) from the ground and spans 31 meters (102 feet) in diameter, creating an impression of the heavens suspended above the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                For nearly a thousand years, Hagia Sophia was the largest Christian cathedral in the world. It was the main center for Orthodox Christianity and hosted numerous important religious ceremonies, including the coronations of Byzantine emperors.

            <p>
                In 1453, Constantinople was conquered by <span class="highlight">Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II</span>, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire. One of his first actions after taking the city was converting Hagia Sophia into a mosque, symbolizing the dominance of Islam over Christianity in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this period, several Islamic elements were added to the structure:
                <ul>
                    <li>Four towering <span class="highlight">minarets</span> were constructed around the building.</li>
                    <li>A <span class="highlight">mihrab</span> (niche indicating the direction of Mecca) replaced the Christian altar.</li>
                    <li>A <span class="highlight">minbar</span> (pulpit) was added for delivering sermons.</li>
                    <li>Large roundels inscribed with the names of Allah, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and the first caliphs were placed inside the building.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the conversion, many Christian elements, such as the mosaics, were not destroyed. Instead, they were plastered over, preserving these invaluable artworks for future generations.

            <h2>3. Hagia Sophia as a Museum (1935)</h2>

            <p>
                After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the formation of the Republic of Turkey, the first president, <span class="highlight">Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</span>, made the decision to secularize Hagia Sophia, turning it into a museum in 1935. This act represented Turkey's shift towards a more secular identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                This transformation allowed people of all faiths to admire the historical and cultural significance of the building. During this time, significant restoration work took place, revealing the hidden Christian mosaics, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>The famous <span class="highlight">Christ Pantocrator</span> mosaic.</li>
                    <li>The mosaics of the <span class="highlight">Virgin Mary</span> and various saints.</li>
                </ul>
                These mosaics, dating back to the 9th and 10th centuries, are among the most valuable examples of Byzantine art.

            <p>
                In July 2020, the Turkish government, under the leadership of President <span class="highlight">Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</span>, announced the re-conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque. This decision was met with both support and controversy globally. While many Muslims welcomed the change, some Christians and UNESCO, which lists Hagia Sophia as a World Heritage Site, expressed concerns about the preservation of the site's historical and multicultural significance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although it now functions as a mosque again, Hagia Sophia remains open to visitors from all faiths. The Christian mosaics are preserved but covered during prayer times, reflecting the balance between its Islamic and Christian heritage.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                Did you know? Hagia Sophia is one of the few buildings in the world that has served as both a church and a mosque, making it a symbol of religious co-existence throughout history.
